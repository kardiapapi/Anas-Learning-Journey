C and assembly 
Passionate about low-level systems programming and self-driven learning, I’ve cultivated foundational skills in Assembly and C through hands-on experimentation. My journey includes reverse-engineering basic concepts—like printing text backward in Assembly—to grasp memory management and processor logic. In C, I built a graphical window from scratch using raw API calls, implementing a pixel buffer to render graphics, which deepened my understanding of OS interactions and real-time performance optimization.

My focus is on problem-solving and systems thinking, prioritizing efficiency and precision. I thrive on dissecting complex challenges independently, iterating until solutions align with technical constraints. This self-guided approach reflects my commitment to mastering core principles before scaling to higher abstractions.
